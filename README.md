# Python-Final-Project-ENSF233
Do you want to see a SCUFFED Python final project?

This Project was during my first-ever Software Classes and truly made me so interested in the idea of coding!
 
Within these sets of code, we analyzed data sets in .csv files which allowed us to create plots and user-interactive communication with the "computer".
With this, we were able to show users the:
- Human Population and its Statistics through time
- Threatened Animal Species
- Graphs that visually represents the data

This project was an awesome experience being able to read files on .csv files and using that to create data in a communicative way with the interest of the user.
Here it is :)
